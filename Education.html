    <h3>About My Education:</h3>
    <blockquote>I am currently pursuing my Intermediate studies at DJ Science College, where I continue to strengthen my academic foundation while also expanding my technical expertise. I have successfully completed my Matriculation from Educators School, which laid the groundwork for my educational journey. To enhance my professional skill set, I earned certifications in CIT (Certificate in Information Technology) and DIT (Diploma in Information Technology), giving me a strong command over fundamental computer and IT concepts. Alongside these, I have also completed a Digital Marketing course, which provided me with valuable insights into online branding, advertising, and audience engagement. At present, I am further advancing my career by learning Modern Web and App Development, enabling me to build responsive, user-friendly websites and applications. This blend of academic education and technical training has helped me develop a versatile background that combines both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.</blockquote>
